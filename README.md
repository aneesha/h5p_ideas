# h5p_ideas
Ideas for new H5P content types.

## Social Model Tracing Tutor
Implement ideas from model tracing tutors as an h5p content type but make the example social.

* Allow for step by step completion of mathematical problems. 
* Has a drag and drop equation editor which supports movement from either side of the = sign.
* Instructors can annotate where students make errors with feedback (as starting point for feedback).
* Student errors are saved back to server for analysis.
* Instructors and students with correct answers can annotate other students errors with feedback.

## Dynamic Explorable
Add a content  type that can be used to build calculators, change variables and draw charts dynamically. Also useful for simulations.

* Allow builder to add equations
* Layout results from equations and set inputs
* Add graphs and outputs to layout
* Dynamically adjust graphs and outputs when inputs change.
